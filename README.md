# CloakedUI
### A UI library for [Cloaked](https://github.com/WriterZephos/Cloaked).

### This project is in its infancy. Stay tuned for updates.

## Introduction
CloakedUI is intended to make building menus and other graphical user interfaces in Monogame using the Cloaked game library a breeze.

With good design patterns and a thoughtful API, CloakedUI will give you the edge you need to solve the most difficult part of building game UI without locking you into unwanted conventions or formulas.

So far, the way CloakedUI works is by adding a GuiPane to your game components, and then adding various GUIContainers and GUIComponents to build the UI you want. GuiLayouts will take care of positioning and scaling of your components, while event listeners will handle any logic that you want to be executed when an interaction happens.

This library is a work in progress and things could change! The plan, however, is to use top notch OOD to make this library easily extensible and extremely user friendly.
